# Oh, WeatherApp
A dynamic weather app that provides real-time weather information for a given location. Built using HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, the app fetches data from a weather API and dynamically updates the background with a random image of the corresponding city or area.

## How It's Made
**Tech Stack**
HTML: Structured the content for a clean and organized layout.
CSS: Utilized Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Employed the fetch method to retrieve weather data dynamically.
Framework of choice: Bootstrap for streamlined design elements.
Development Process
The project began with HTML markup to create a user-friendly interface. Bootstrap was instrumental in achieving a visually appealing design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

JavaScript played a crucial role in implementing the functionality of fetching weather data from an API. The dynamic background feature was achieved by integrating a random image generator based on the user's selected location.

The fetch method was employed to interact with the weather API, ensuring the app stays up-to-date with accurate information. This project showcases my ability to combine HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a responsive and visually engaging web application.
